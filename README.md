# CATT
Our Project is the Cash and Transaction Tracker, A lightweight web application for managing expenses, visualizing spending habits, and tracking budgets.

The Cash & Transaction Tracker is a simple, web application built using React and Python. The goal of the project is to give users a straightforward way to: add expenses manually, track recent transactions, view spending breakdowns by category, and monitor remaining monthly budget.

The frontend is designed without any external UI or charting libraries to keep setup minimal and ensure compatibility across environments.

We have an Expense Form where you can Enter amount, category, date, and description for your transactions.

We also have a dashboard where you can view an overview of your financial activity including, motnhly budget remaining, spending by category in the form of a Pie CHart, and recent transactions.
 
We have added tests for our application, and the Black Box Test Plan Static Page is here: https://sennoel.github.io/CATT/
