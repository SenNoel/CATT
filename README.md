# CATT
Our Project is the Cash and Transaction Tracker, A lightweight web application for managing expenses, visualizing spending habits, and tracking budgets.

The Cash & Transaction Tracker is a simple, dependency-free web application built using React. The goal of the project is to give users a straightforward way to:

Add expenses manually
Track recent transactions
View spending breakdowns by category
Monitor remaining monthly budget

The frontend is designed without any external UI or charting libraries to keep setup minimal and ensure compatibility across environments.
